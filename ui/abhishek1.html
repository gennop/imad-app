            Hii...Everyone.
            <br/>
            The foremost quality you need to develop for minimizing barriers in communication is empathy. Empathy is different from sympathy. If you see a beggar, who is shivering from cold or starving without money to eat food, and you offer him a woolen blanket or give him some money, you feel sympathy for the beggar. However, empathy is not feeling for, but feeling into.
